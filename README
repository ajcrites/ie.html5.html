The purpose of html5.ie.html is to provide a small html snippet that lets all HTML5 elements
work properly in versions of MSIE before IE9 (IE9 tends to support these).  In addition,
it applies basic styles based on the Webkit user agent stylesheet.
The "style" and "script" can also be added to separate CSS and JavaScript files, respectively.
To use, simply put this html snippet anywhere in your html (but preferably in the head).
CSS and JavaScript files are also provided.  Include these in your html normally.
